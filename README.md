# Gender-classification
The gender classification model processes images of men and women using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with ResNet-50 for feature extraction. Initially, a custom CNN is trained from scratch to learn gender-specific features from images. The learned weights and extracted features are then integrated into ResNet-50, where skip connections help retain essential information, while unnecessary layers are frozen to reduce computational complexity and improve efficiency.

To assess the model's performance, classification results are evaluated using a Confusion Matrix, which provides insights into true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative rates. Additionally, the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve is used to measure the modelâ€™s ability to distinguish between male and female classifications by analyzing the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. This approach ensures robust performance, leveraging deep learning techniques for accurate gender classification.
